		<h1>Ride</h1>
		<h3>Lana Del Rey</h3>
		<p>I've been out on that open road
You can be my full time daddy, white and gold
Singing blues has been getting old
You can be my full time baby, hot or cold

Don't break me down
I've been traveling too long
I've been trying too hard
With one pretty song</p>
		<p>I hear the birds on the summer breeze
I drive fast, I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble
But I, I've got a war in my mind
So I just ride, just ride, I just ride, I just ride

Dying young and playing hard
That's the way my father made his life an art
Drink all day and we talk till dark
That’s the way the road dogs do it, light till dark

Don't leave me now
Don't say goodbye
Don't turn around
			Leave me high and dry</p>
		<p>I hear the birds on the summer breeze
I drive fast, I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get in trouble
But I, I've got a war in my mind
I just ride, just ride, I just ride, I just ride

I'm tired of feeling like I'm fucking crazy
I'm tired of driving till I see stars in my eyes
It's all I've got to keep myself sane, baby
So I just ride, I just ride

I hear the birds on the summer breeze
I drive fast, I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get in trouble
But I, I've got a war in my mind
I just ride, just ride, I just ride, I just ride

Every night I used to pray that I’d find my people and finally I did on the open road. We had nothing to lose, nothing to gain, nothing we desired anymore except to make our lives into a work of art. Live fast. Die young. Be wild. And have fun.

I believe in the country America used to be. I believe in the person I want to become. I believe in the freedom of the open road. And my motto is the same as ever. I believe in the kindness of strangers. And when I'm at war with myself, I ride. I just ride.

Who are you? Are you in touch with all of your darkest fantasies? Have you created a life for yourself where you can experience them? I have. I am fucking crazy. But I am free.</p>
