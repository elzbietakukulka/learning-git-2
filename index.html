				<h1>"Ride"</h1>
				<h3>Lana Del Rey</h3>
				<p>I've been out on that open road<br>
					You can be my full time daddy, white and gold<br>
					Singing blues has been getting old<br>
					You can be my full time baby, hot or cold<br>
					<br>

					Don't break me down<br>
					I've been traveling too long<br>
					I've been trying too hard<br>
					With one pretty song<br></p>
				<p>I hear the birds on the summer breeze<br>
					I drive fast, I am alone at midnight<br>
					Been trying hard not to get into trouble<br>
					But I, I've got a war in my mind<br>
					So I just ride, just ride, I just ride, I just ride<br>
					<br>

					Dying young and playing hard<br>
					That's the way my father made his life an art<br>
					Drink all day and we talk till dark<br>
					That’s the way the road dogs do it, light till dark<br>
					<br>

					Don't leave me now<br>
					Don't say goodbye<br>
					Don't turn around<br>
					Leave me high and dry<br></p>
				<p>I hear the birds on the summer breeze<br>
					I drive fast, I am alone at midnight<br>
					Been trying hard not to get in trouble<br>
					But I, I've got a war in my mind<br>
					I just ride, just ride, I just ride, I just ride<br>
					<br>

					I'm tired of feeling like I'm fucking crazy<br>
					I'm tired of driving till I see stars in my eyes<br>
					It's all I've got to keep myself sane, baby<br>
					So I just ride, I just ride<br>
					<br>

					I hear the birds on the summer breeze<br>
					I drive fast, I am alone at midnight<br>
					Been trying hard not to get in trouble<br>
					But I, I've got a war in my mind<br>
					I just ride, just ride, I just ride, I just ride<br>
					<br></p>
