		<h1>Ride</h1>
		<h3>Lana Del Rey</h3>
		<p>I've been out on that open road
You can be my full time daddy, white and gold
Singing blues has been getting old
You can be my full time baby, hot or cold

Don't break me down
I've been traveling too long
I've been trying too hard
With one pretty song</p>
		<p>I hear the birds on the summer breeze
I drive fast, I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble
But I, I've got a war in my mind
So I just ride, just ride, I just ride, I just ride

Dying young and playing hard
That's the way my father made his life an art
Drink all day and we talk till dark
That’s the way the road dogs do it, light till dark

Don't leave me now
Don't say goodbye
Don't turn around
			Leave me high and dry</p>
